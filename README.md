# Note

To play this game you'll have to download these files and save them in your device
then open the index.html in any browser there you can play the game, I still don't know how to
publish a game which could be played online on web page.

This game might not be perfect as i am still new to these but i tried my best ,
there might be some bugs or errors while playing it so if you found bugs please let me know,
or you can just help me fix them as well.

Enjoy the game Thankyou
